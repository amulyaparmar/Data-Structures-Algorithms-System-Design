Concurrency - when tasks are completed at the same time but not necessarily simultaneously
Program - multiple processes
Process - multiple threads 
Thread - small unit of task
Deadlock - threads waiting for each other
Starvation - thread is blocked from a resource
Memory Coherence - controls read and write to same location in memory
  - all writes to the same location are seen in the same order by all threads 
  - (print A)
  - (everyone sees the same winner)
Memory Consistency - controls read and write to other locations in memory
  - allowed orderings of multiple threads on a multiprocessor 
  - (print A print B)

IPC - Inter Process Communication 
TCP - Transmission Control Protocol - ensures reliable transmission of packets of data

Vertical Scaling
Horizontal Scaling
CDN - Content Delivery Network
CAP - Consistency = read operations return the most recent write operation value

Availability  = all requests get response (success/failure)
and Partition tolerant
    - need replicated data
ACID - transactions should have Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
BASE - Basic Availability, Soft state, Eventual consistency - stale data / approximate answers are OK
