ex1:
1, 1, 2 => 5
min num of rabbits

c = {
    1: 2
    2: 1
}

i = 1 2
(n + x / x + 1) * x + 1
(2 + 1 / 1 + 1) * 1 + 1 = 2
(1 + 2 / 2 + 1) * 2 + 1 = 3

ex2:
2 (x+1) rabbits have same color
all of them would answer 1 (x)

2 (n) rabbits answer 1 (x)

2 / 1 + 1 = 2

ex3:
3 rabbits that would answer 2
1 rabbits answer 2 #need 1 group. thus: round up

6 rabbits that answer 2 (x)
6 % 3 == 0 need 2 groups

7 rabbits that answer 2
7 % 3 != 0 need 3 groups #thus: round up
