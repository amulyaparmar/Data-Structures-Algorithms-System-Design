Dynamic Programming
minChange

Sorts and Searches
	Iterative bin search
Backtracking

Trees and Graphs
	BFS, DFS
	Graph - BFS
	X, y
	Dirs = 
	Xi, yj if in bounds

Strings and Arrays
Kadane’s - largest contig sum in arr
Rabin Karp - hashing to find pattern in string

Pathing
Bellman-Ford
Dijkstra’s
(source is “a”)
Set up distances = {a: 0, b: ∞, c: ∞, d: ∞
Set up unvisited (a, b, c, d,
While unvisited.length:
	Find the closest, unvisited node 
	Remove from unvisited
	Check all neighbors
		If best distance to neighbor is greater than best distance to current + dist from curr to neighbor, then change best to that
